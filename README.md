## Discourse Wikified Posts

This Theme Component allows enables you to make Wiki posts more obvious.

You can set the background color, which is applied to all Wiki posts.

You can also set some text, which is placed to the immediate left of the edit history icon in the top right of each wiki post. The colour of this text changes dynamically as the edit state changes (this is in core).

This was forked from https://github.com/pacharanero/discourse-wikified-post-background-color, and re-used code from https://github.com/naidihr/discourse-message-bubbles
